Game Modes!

These preferences are replaced with "Game Modes":
 * Duration
 * Board size
 * Min word length
 * Scoring type
 * Hint modes

You can change game mode from the main screen, or create your own. High scores are based on game mode and lexicon.

Fixed critical bug in 2.0.0-alpha1 (thanks to all who reported the issue).
